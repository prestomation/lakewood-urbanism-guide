As the city undertakes its 2024 zoning code update, ADU policy could expand housing options without changing neighborhood character.\nLearn more: HUD ADU Case Study | MRSC ADU Overview\nBoard of Zoning Appeals (BZA)# A city board that hears requests for variances from zoning requirements and appeals of administrative zoning decisions.\nWhy it matters: The BZA is where property owners seek permission to deviate from zoning rules — such as building closer to a property line than normally allowed.
