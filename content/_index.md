# Lakewood Urbanism Guide

A practical reference for urbanists and advocates in **Lakewood, Ohio** — the most walkable and densely populated city in the state.

Lakewood is a [5.53-square-mile inner-ring streetcar suburb](https://lakewoodhistory.org/preservation/a-brief-history-of-lakewood/) of Cleveland with over [50,000 residents](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/accordions/lakewood-at-a-glance/) and a population density of roughly [9,400 people per square mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood,_Ohio) — comparable to Washington, D.C. Its walkable streets, mixed-use commercial corridors, and dense historic housing stock make it a natural laboratory for urbanism in the Midwest.

## Why Lakewood?

Lakewood occupies a unique position among American suburbs. Built out almost entirely during the [streetcar era (1893–1930)](https://case.edu/ech/articles/l/lakewood), it has a pre-automobile urban form — narrow lots, front porches, detached garages in the rear, and commercial corridors within walking distance of every neighborhood. The city has [never operated school buses](https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-lakewood-ohio-walking-school.html) because every student lives close enough to walk.

Two major commercial corridors — **Detroit Avenue** and **Madison Avenue** — run the length of the city with a [100-year history of mixed-use buildings](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/) featuring apartments over retail. The city has seen over [$65 million invested](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/) along these corridors in recent years, anchored by the [$119 million Lakewood Common](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/groundbreaking-scheduled-for-lakewood-downtown-development-project/) mixed-use development on the former hospital site.

This guide helps residents, advocates, and newcomers understand the policies, terminology, and history behind Lakewood's urban character — and participate effectively in shaping its future.
