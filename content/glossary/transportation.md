# Transportation Terms

### Active Transportation

Any human-powered mode of travel — walking, bicycling, skateboarding, using a wheelchair, etc. Distinguished from motorized transportation.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood adopted an [Active Transportation Strategic Plan](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) in April 2024 after an 18-month planning process. The plan identifies infrastructure projects, policies, and programs to improve conditions for walking and biking.

### Complete Streets

A transportation policy that requires streets to be designed and operated to enable safe access for all users — pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and motorists of all ages and abilities.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood's [Complete Streets ordinance](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) was introduced in 2025 as a practical implementation roadmap for the Active Transportation plan. Council President Sarah Kepple described it as moving from the strategic plan's "big picture" to "how the work gets done."

### Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA)

The public transit agency serving Cuyahoga County, including Lakewood. Operates bus routes, the Red Line rapid transit, and paratransit services.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood is served by [six RTA bus routes (25, 26, 43, 55, 78, 83)](https://www.riderta.com/routes) and two rapid rail stations (W. 117th and Triskett). Transit access varies significantly across the city, leading to "last mile" challenges for many residents.

### High-Risk Network

A map of roads with the highest risk for pedestrian and bicycle crashes, based on historical crash data and statistical modeling of roadway characteristics.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood's Active Transportation plan identifies a [High-Risk Network for Walking and Biking](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) that highlights Detroit Avenue, Madison Avenue, 117th Street, Clifton Boulevard, Hilliard Road, and Franklin Avenue as the roads with the most potential for future crashes.

### Last Mile

The gap between a transit stop and a rider's final destination. Often the most difficult part of a transit trip to serve efficiently.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood [hired Iteris Inc.](https://www.ideastream.org/community/2024-04-24/lakewood-studying-options-to-close-the-last-mile-gap-in-public-transit) in 2024 to study options for closing the last mile gap, using nearly $150,000 in county-awarded American Rescue Act funds. The city's previous circulator service was discontinued roughly 15 years ago.

### Level of Service (LOS)

A metric (graded A through F) that measures traffic flow and congestion on roads and at intersections. Originally designed for car throughput.

**Why it matters:** LOS has historically been used to justify wider roads and more car lanes. Urbanists argue it fails to account for pedestrian safety, transit efficiency, and non-car modes. Lakewood's Complete Streets approach rebalances priorities beyond LOS.

### Mode Share

The percentage of trips taken by each transportation mode — car, transit, walking, biking, etc.

**Why it matters:** In Lakewood, an estimated [77% of residents commute by car, while about 10% walk or use transit](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/mobility/). The Active Transportation plan aims to shift mode share toward walking and cycling by improving infrastructure.

### Safe Routes to School

A federal and local program that promotes walking and biking to school through infrastructure improvements, education, and encouragement.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood has [never operated school buses](https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-lakewood-ohio-walking-school.html) — every student walks to school. The city partners with [Lakewood City Schools, PTA, and Bike Lakewood](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/bikinglakewood/) to support walking school buses and bike trains.

### Walk Score

A national ranking system that measures the walkability of any address or city on a 0-100 scale based on proximity to amenities.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood has the [highest Walk Score in Ohio at 70](https://www.walkscore.com/OH/), compared to the state average of 34. The city has [over 180 miles of sidewalks](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/mobility/) serving its 90 miles of streets.
