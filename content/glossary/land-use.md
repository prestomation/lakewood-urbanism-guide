# Land Use Terms

### Architectural Board of Review (ABR)

A city board that reviews exterior modifications to buildings in designated districts to ensure compatibility with neighborhood character.

**Why it matters:** In Lakewood, the ABR works alongside the Heritage Advisory Board to protect the architectural character of historic areas. Any significant exterior change in review areas requires ABR approval.

### Community Vision

Lakewood's guiding planning document, serving in place of a traditional master plan. Adopted in 2012 and updated in 2017 and 2019, it provides the framework for city planning decisions.

**Why it matters:** The [Community Vision](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/) is the document that shapes Lakewood's future. Its six focus areas — commercial development, housing, community wellness, safety, mobility, and education/culture — guide zoning decisions, capital investments, and policy priorities. The 2024 zoning code update is being aligned with the Vision.

### Comprehensive Plan

A long-range planning document that guides a community's growth and development. In Ohio, municipalities are authorized but not required to adopt one.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood uses its Community Vision in place of a traditional comprehensive plan. Ohio's planning enabling statutes give cities broad authority to plan and zone, but don't mandate a specific format.

### Inner-Ring Suburb

A suburb that was developed adjacent to a central city, typically before or during the early automobile era, with denser development patterns than outer suburbs.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood is a textbook inner-ring suburb — built along [streetcar lines between 1893 and 1930](https://lakewoodhistory.org/preservation/a-brief-history-of-lakewood/), fully built out with no undeveloped land. Its challenges (aging infrastructure, fixed boundaries) and assets (density, walkability, transit access) are characteristic of inner-ring communities.

### Nonconforming Use

A land use or building that was legal when established but no longer complies with current zoning regulations.

**Why it matters:** Because Lakewood was almost entirely built out before the current zoning code, many properties are legally nonconforming. Understanding nonconforming status matters for renovations, expansions, and property transactions.

### Resiliency Planning

An extension of the Community Vision that addresses long-term threats including climate change, housing insecurity, and economic disruption.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood's [resiliency initiative](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/resiliency/) builds on the Community Vision to help the city "endure, adapt, and thrive" in the face of challenges including climate change effects on Lake Erie, aging infrastructure, and demographic shifts.

### Streetcar Suburb

A residential area that developed along streetcar (trolley) lines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by compact lots, walkable streets, and commercial corridors along transit routes.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood is one of Cleveland's three classic streetcar suburbs. The [Detroit Avenue line opened in 1893, Clifton Boulevard in 1903, and Madison Avenue in 1916](https://lakewoodhistory.org/preservation/a-brief-history-of-lakewood/). Neighborhoods grew around these lines, producing the dense, walkable form that defines Lakewood today.

### Upzoning

Changing zoning regulations to allow greater density or intensity of use — such as permitting multifamily housing where only single-family was previously allowed.

**Why it matters:** As Lakewood undertakes its zoning code update, questions about whether to upzone certain areas to allow more housing or mixed-use development are central to the discussion. The city's existing density and built form mean upzoning typically involves infill rather than greenfield development.
