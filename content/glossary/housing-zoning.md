# Housing & Zoning Terms

### Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU)

A smaller, secondary housing unit on the same lot as a primary residence — such as a basement apartment, garage conversion, or backyard cottage.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood's dense, narrow-lot housing stock presents both challenges and opportunities for ADUs. As the city undertakes its [2024 zoning code update](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/zoning-update2024/), ADU policy could expand housing options without changing neighborhood character.

### Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA)

A city board that hears requests for variances from zoning requirements and appeals of administrative zoning decisions.

**Why it matters:** The BZA is where property owners seek permission to deviate from zoning rules — such as building closer to a property line than normally allowed. [Agendas are posted publicly](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/accordions/board-of-zoning-appeals-agendas/).

### Community Reinvestment Area (CRA)

A state-authorized tax incentive program that provides property tax abatements for new construction or renovation in designated areas, encouraging private investment.

**Why it matters:** The [Lakewood Common](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/groundbreaking-scheduled-for-lakewood-downtown-development-project/) redevelopment site was designated a CRA, allowing up to 15 years of property tax abatement on structures to make the $119 million project financially viable.

### Conditional Use Permit

Permission granted by the Planning Commission to use a property in a way that is allowed under the zoning code only with special approval and conditions.

**Why it matters:** In Lakewood, conditional use permits are reviewed by the [Planning Commission](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/planning-commission/), which may attach conditions to protect neighboring properties. These hearings are public and open to comment.

### Historic Preservation District (HPD)

A zoning overlay that protects the architectural character of a designated area by requiring review of exterior changes to buildings.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood has designated HPD zones and individual Historic Properties (HP) under its zoning code. The **Birdtown** neighborhood was designated a [National Register Historic District in 2006](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/). Exterior modifications in these areas go through the Architectural Board of Review.

### Housing Forward

A City of Lakewood initiative that uses comprehensive surveys and data on the city's [12,700 one- and two-family homes](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/housing/) to guide housing policy, code enforcement, and investment.

**Why it matters:** Housing Forward gives the city detailed data on housing conditions, helping target resources where they're most needed and informing the zoning code update.

### Mixed-Use Development

A building or project that combines residential units with commercial space (typically retail or office on the ground floor with apartments above).

**Why it matters:** Mixed-use is the historic norm in Lakewood — Detroit and Madison Avenues have a [100-year history of apartments over retail](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/). The Lakewood Common project continues this pattern with 25,000 sq ft of retail below 305 residential units.

### Variance

Permission from the Board of Zoning Appeals to deviate from a specific zoning requirement (such as setbacks, height limits, or lot coverage) when strict compliance would cause practical difficulty.

**Why it matters:** Because Lakewood was built out before the current zoning code, many existing properties are already nonconforming. Variances are common when owners renovate or expand.

**Learn more:** [Lakewood BZA](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/accordions/board-of-zoning-appeals-agendas/)

### Zoning Code

The set of regulations that governs how land can be used, what can be built, and development standards (setbacks, height, density, parking) for each zoning district.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood's zoning code was [last comprehensively updated in 1996](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/zoning-update2024/). The city launched a major update process in 2024 to align the code with the Community Vision and modern best practices for a dense, historic community.
