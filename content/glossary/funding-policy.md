# Funding & Policy Terms

### Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)

An annual federal grant from HUD to communities of 50,000+ people for housing, economic development, and public services benefiting low- and moderate-income residents.

**Why it matters:** Lakewood is a [CDBG entitlement community](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/housing/), meaning it receives annual grants directly from HUD. The Department of Planning and Development administers these funds for housing rehabilitation, infrastructure, and economic development programs.

### Commercial Property Revitalization Program

A City of Lakewood program providing rebates to businesses and property owners who complete storefront improvements along the city's commercial corridors.

**Why it matters:** The program specifically targets [Detroit Avenue, Madison Avenue, and Berea Road](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/) — Lakewood's three commercial corridors — to maintain and improve the streetscape and attract businesses.

### Community Reinvestment Area (CRA)

An Ohio state program that provides property tax abatements for new construction or renovation in designated areas to incentivize private investment.

**Why it matters:** The Lakewood Common redevelopment site was designated a CRA, allowing a [property tax abatement on structures for up to 15 years](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/groundbreaking-scheduled-for-lakewood-downtown-development-project/). The city, school district, and developer split excess revenues generated by the project's TIF.

### Impact Fees

One-time charges assessed on new development to fund infrastructure improvements (roads, water, sewer, parks) needed to serve the new development.

**Why it matters:** As a fully built-out city, Lakewood's development is primarily infill and redevelopment rather than greenfield. Impact fee structures must account for existing infrastructure capacity rather than entirely new systems.

### Main Street Program

A revitalization approach developed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation that focuses on economic development within the context of historic preservation for traditional commercial districts.

**Why it matters:** [LakewoodAlive](https://www.lakewoodalive.org/) is a member of Heritage Ohio, the oversight organization for the Ohio Main Street Program. The organization achieved National Main Street designation in 2005, guiding revitalization of downtown Lakewood's commercial corridors.

### Startup Lakewood

A City of Lakewood initiative designed to make Lakewood a more appealing place for entrepreneurs to build and grow businesses.

**Why it matters:** The program supports Lakewood's [small business character](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/) — 95% of the 300 businesses on Madison Avenue are locally owned. The initiative complements the Commercial Property Revitalization Program.

### Tax Increment Financing (TIF)

A public financing tool that uses the increase in property tax revenue generated by new development to pay for infrastructure improvements that support that development.

**Why it matters:** TIF was a key financing mechanism for the [Lakewood Common project](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/groundbreaking-scheduled-for-lakewood-downtown-development-project/). The city, Lakewood City Schools, and the developer equally split excess TIF revenues. The city also approved a $5 million loan to build the project's parking garage.

### Tax Abatement

A reduction or elimination of property taxes for a defined period, used to incentivize development, renovation, or other investment.

**Why it matters:** Tax abatements are a common tool in Northeast Ohio for encouraging development. The Lakewood Common project includes a CRA-based abatement. Understanding the terms (duration, scope, what's abated) is important for evaluating whether public benefits justify the tax revenue foregone.
