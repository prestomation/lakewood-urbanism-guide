# Quick Start: How Lakewood Works

A primer on Lakewood's government structure and planning framework for urbanists and advocates.

## City Government

Lakewood operates under a **council-manager** form of government. The [City Council](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/lakewood-city-council/) is the legislative body, and the Mayor serves as the chief executive.

### City Council

Lakewood City Council has **seven members**:
- **3 at-large members** representing the entire city
- **4 ward members** representing each of the city's four wards

Councilmembers are elected in [non-partisan elections](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/lakewood-city-council/) and serve **four-year staggered terms** — every two years there is an election for either the at-large or ward positions. Council members serve part-time and typically maintain separate employment.

**Meetings:** General meetings are held the **first and third Monday** of every month at 7:30 p.m. in Council Chambers at [Lakewood City Hall, 12650 Detroit Avenue](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/lakewood-city-council/). All meetings are open to the public and livestreamed.

### Key Boards and Commissions

- **[Planning Commission](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/planning-commission/)** — Five members (three appointed by the Mayor, two by Council) who review conditional use permits and other zoning matters. Members serve five-year terms.
- **[Board of Zoning Appeals](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/accordions/board-of-zoning-appeals-agendas/)** — Hears variance requests and appeals of zoning decisions.
- **[Architectural Board of Review](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/planning-zoning/)** — Reviews exterior modifications in certain districts.
- **[Lakewood Heritage Advisory Board](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/planning-zoning/)** — Advises on historic preservation matters.
- **[Human Rights Commission](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/planning-zoning/)** — Established in 2016 as part of the city's comprehensive Human Rights Ordinance protecting citizens from discrimination in housing, employment, education, and public accommodations.

## Planning Framework

### The Community Vision

Lakewood does not use a traditional master plan. Instead, the city follows the **[Community Vision](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/)**, first passed by City Council and the Planning Commission in 2012 and updated with data refreshes in 2017 and 2019.

The Community Vision centers on **six focus areas**:

1. **Commercial Development** — Vibrant business corridors along Detroit and Madison Avenues
2. **Housing** — Stable housing market with diverse stock and moderate growth in values
3. **Community Wellness** — Public health, recreation, and quality of life
4. **Safety** — Public safety services and infrastructure
5. **Mobility** — Multi-modal transportation and walkability
6. **Education and Culture** — Schools, libraries, arts, and cultural institutions

### Zoning Code

Lakewood's [Planning and Zoning Code](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/lakewood/latest/lakewood_oh/0-0-0-72460) (Part Eleven of the Codified Ordinances) was last comprehensively updated in **1996** with piecemeal revisions since. In **2024**, the city began seeking a [qualified consultant to lead a comprehensive zoning code update](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/zoning-update2024/) aligned with the Community Vision and contemporary best practices for a dense, historic, urban community.

Key zoning districts include:
- Single-Family Residential
- Single- and Two-Family Residential
- Multiple-Family Residential
- Commercial Districts
- Industrial District
- Historic Preservation Districts (HPD)

The [Lakewood Zoning Map](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/accordions/zoning-map/) is available on the city website.

### Department of Planning and Development

The [Department of Planning and Development](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/planning-and-development/) coordinates:
- Long-range planning and zoning
- Economic development
- [Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/housing/) administration — as a city of 50,000+, Lakewood is a CDBG entitlement community receiving annual federal grants for housing and economic development
