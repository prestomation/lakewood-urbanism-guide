# Housing in Lakewood

Lakewood's housing stock reflects its streetcar-era origins — dense, diverse, and almost entirely built before the mid-20th century. With [32,000 housing units](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/housing/) in 5.53 square miles, the city has one of the highest housing densities in the Midwest. A mix of single-family homes, duplexes, and apartment buildings gives the city a variety not typically found in suburban communities.

## Current State

### Housing Stock

Lakewood has approximately [32,000 total housing units](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/housing/), including:
- **12,700 one- or two-family homes** — The core of the city's residential neighborhoods
- **Multifamily apartments** — Concentrated along and near the commercial corridors
- **Mixed-use buildings** — A [100-year tradition](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/) of apartments above retail on Detroit and Madison Avenues

The city earned the nickname "City of Beautiful Homes" because it was [intentionally designed in the early 1900s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood,_Ohio) with minimal industry and an emphasis on diverse residential architecture.

### Housing Density

At approximately [5,150 housing units per square mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood,_Ohio), Lakewood has a housing density comparable to many urban neighborhoods. Streetcar-era homes are typically 2.5-story structures on narrow lots with front porches and detached rear garages.

### Lakewood Common

The most significant housing development in recent years is the [$119 million Lakewood Common](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/groundbreaking-scheduled-for-lakewood-downtown-development-project/) project on the former Lakewood Hospital site, which broke ground September 25, 2025. The project includes:
- **305 total residential units** — 293 new apartments (including affordable units), 5 renovated Curtis Block units, and 7 Belle Avenue townhomes
- **25,000 sq ft of new retail** plus renovated Curtis Block ground-floor retail
- **17,000 sq ft public plaza** and community event space
- **Pocket park and linear park** along Belle Avenue
- **Pedestrian walkways** connecting the public plaza to surrounding streets

The project is developed by [CASTO Communities](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/city-of-lakewood-enters-formal-agreement-to-redevelop-former-lakewood-hospital-site/) with Panzica Construction and Dimit Architects. It was financed through a combination of private investment, a [Community Reinvestment Area (CRA)]({{< relref "/glossary/funding-policy#community-reinvestment-area-cra" >}}) tax abatement, [Tax Increment Financing (TIF)]({{< relref "/glossary/funding-policy#tax-increment-financing-tif" >}}), and a $5 million city loan for the parking garage.

## History

### 1893–1930: Streetcar-Era Build-Out

Lakewood's housing was [built rapidly](https://lakewoodhistory.org/preservation/a-brief-history-of-lakewood/) as streetcar lines opened up the area to residential development. The population grew from roughly 3,000 in 1900 to over 58,000 by 1930 as farms were subdivided and real estate speculators developed the area.

### 1892: Birdtown Established

The [Birdtown neighborhood](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/commercial-development/) was established for New York Central Railroad employees, featuring modest Victorian-era homes and dense row housing. It was designated a National Register Historic District in 2006.

### 1996: Last Zoning Code Update

The [current zoning code](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/zoning-update2024/) was comprehensively adopted, governing residential districts, setbacks, heights, and density standards that shape housing development.

### 2009: LakewoodAlive Housing Outreach

[LakewoodAlive](https://www.lakewoodalive.org/about-us/) launched its Housing Outreach Program, connecting low- to moderate-income residents with housing resources, educational services, volunteer labor, and a paint rebate program.

### 2016: Human Rights Ordinance

The city established a [Human Rights Commission](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/planning-zoning/) with a comprehensive ordinance protecting against discrimination in housing, employment, education, and public accommodations.

### 2024: Zoning Code Update and Lakewood Common Approval

The city [launched a comprehensive zoning code update](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/zoning-update2024/) and approved the formal agreement for the [Lakewood Common redevelopment](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/city-of-lakewood-enters-formal-agreement-to-redevelop-former-lakewood-hospital-site/).

## How the City Manages Housing

### Department of Planning and Development

- Zoning administration and long-range planning
- [CDBG program administration](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/housing/) — annual federal grants for housing and economic development
- Economic development incentives

### Housing Forward Initiative

The [Housing Forward](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/housing/) initiative uses comprehensive surveys to collect data on the city's 12,700 one- and two-family homes — providing more detailed information on housing conditions than ever before and guiding targeted investment.

### 2024 Zoning Code Update

The [zoning code update](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/zoning-update2024/) aims to align regulations with the Community Vision and integrate contemporary best practices for a dense, historic community, including a framework that promotes sustainability and climate resilience.
