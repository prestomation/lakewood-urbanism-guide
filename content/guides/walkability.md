# Walkability in Lakewood

Lakewood is the [most walkable city in Ohio](https://www.walkscore.com/OH/) with a Walk Score of 70 — nearly double the state average of 34. The city's pre-automobile urban form, dense housing, and commercial corridors within walking distance of every neighborhood make walking a viable mode of transportation, not just recreation.

## Current State

Lakewood has [over 180 miles of sidewalks](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/mobility/) serving 90 miles of streets across 5.53 square miles. An estimated [77% of residents commute by car](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/mobility/), while approximately 10% walk or use public transit — a high non-car mode share for a Midwestern suburb.

The city's walkability stems from its physical form:
- **Narrow lots and dense housing** — [9,400 residents per square mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakewood,_Ohio), the highest density in Ohio
- **Mixed-use corridors** — Detroit and Madison Avenues provide retail, dining, and services within walking distance of most neighborhoods
- **Grid street pattern** — The streetcar-era grid provides direct, connected routes
- **No school buses** — Lakewood has [never operated school buses](https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-lakewood-ohio-walking-school.html) because every student lives close enough to walk
- **Neighborhood parks** — Most residents live within a five-minute walk of a park

## History

### 1893–1916: Streetcar Development

Lakewood's walkable form was established during the [streetcar era](https://lakewoodhistory.org/preservation/a-brief-history-of-lakewood/). The Detroit Avenue line opened in 1893, Clifton Boulevard in 1903, and Madison Avenue in 1916. Neighborhoods and commercial districts grew along these lines, creating a compact, walkable city.

### 1910–1930: Rapid Build-Out

Lakewood's population [grew by 55,328](https://case.edu/ech/articles/s/suburbs) between 1910 and 1930 as the city was almost entirely built out with streetcar-era housing. The 2.5-story homes on narrow lots with front porches and rear garages established the pedestrian-oriented character that persists today.

### 2012: Community Vision

The [Community Vision](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/) established mobility as one of six focus areas, recognizing walkability as central to Lakewood's identity and quality of life.

### 2024: Active Transportation Strategic Plan

Council adopted the [Active Transportation and Safety Action Plans](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) in April 2024 after 18 months of planning. The plan identified a High-Risk Network of roads with the highest pedestrian and bicycle crash risk.

### 2025: Complete Streets Ordinance

The [Complete Streets ordinance](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) was introduced to require multimodal consideration in every transportation project. The city earmarked [$3 million in its 2025 budget](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) for street improvements, traffic signals, and sidewalks.

## Pedestrian Safety

Crash data from the Active Transportation plan show high concentrations of pedestrian crashes along:
- **Detroit Avenue** — The primary commercial corridor
- **Madison Avenue** — The secondary commercial corridor
- **117th Street** — A major north-south connector
- **Clifton Boulevard** — A wide arterial along the northern edge
- **Hilliard Road and Franklin Avenue** — Additional high-risk corridors

The [High-Risk Network for Walking and Biking](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) map uses historical data and a statistical model based on roadway characteristics to identify where future crashes are most likely.

## Advocacy Organizations

- **[Bike Lakewood](https://www.bikecleveland.org/bikelakewood/)** — Resident-led advocacy for people who walk and bike in Lakewood. A chapter of Bike Cleveland.
- **[LakewoodAlive](https://www.lakewoodalive.org/)** — Community development corporation that supports walkable neighborhoods through housing outreach and community events.
