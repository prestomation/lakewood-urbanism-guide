# Bike Network in Lakewood

Lakewood's compact size (5.53 square miles), flat terrain, and grid street network make it well-suited for cycling. The city has been working to formalize and expand bicycle infrastructure since the [2012 Bicycle Master Plan](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/bikinglakewood/) and the [2024 Active Transportation Strategic Plan](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/).

## Current State

Lakewood's bike infrastructure is still developing. The city's Active Transportation and Safety Action Plans, [adopted April 15, 2024](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/), provide a comprehensive framework for expanding the network through:

- **Infrastructure projects** — Physical changes to roadways to provide space for cyclists
- **Policy recommendations** — Regulatory changes to prioritize active transportation
- **Program recommendations** — Education, encouragement, and enforcement initiatives

The plans were the product of an 18-month process involving city staff, professional consultants, community stakeholders, and public input.

## History

### 2012: Bicycle Master Plan

City Council approved the [Bicycle Master Plan](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/bikinglakewood/), establishing a vision to make bicycling a primary means of transportation and accommodate current cyclists' needs through policies, programs, and projects.

### 2024: Active Transportation Strategic Plan

The Active Transportation and Safety Action Plans were [adopted by Council](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) on April 15, 2024. The plans identify a High-Risk Network for Walking and Biking, highlighting corridors with the highest crash potential:
- Detroit Avenue
- Madison Avenue
- 117th Street
- Clifton Boulevard
- Hilliard Road
- Franklin Avenue

### 2025: Complete Streets Ordinance

The [Complete Streets ordinance](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) was jointly introduced by Mayor George, Councilmember Baker, Council President Kepple, and Councilmember Strebig. It would require all transportation projects to consider the needs of cyclists alongside pedestrians, transit users, and drivers.

## How the City Plans and Funds It

The 2024 Active Transportation plan serves as the long-term strategic framework, while the 2025 Complete Streets ordinance provides the [implementation roadmap](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/).

The city has earmarked [$3 million in its 2025 budget](https://thelandcle.org/stories/lakewood-prioritizes-safe-streets-with-active-transportation-strategic-plan-complete-streets-ordinance/) for street improvements, traffic signals, and sidewalks — infrastructure that also benefits cyclists.

## Safe Routes to School

The city partners with [Lakewood City Schools, PTA, and Bike Lakewood](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/bikinglakewood/) to support Safe Routes to School programming, including:
- Walking school buses
- Bike trains
- Safety education

This is built on Lakewood's unique foundation: the city has [never operated school buses](https://www.governing.com/archive/gov-lakewood-ohio-walking-school.html), making safe walking and biking routes a practical necessity.

## Advocacy Organizations

- **[Bike Lakewood](https://www.bikecleveland.org/bikelakewood/)** — A resident-led advocacy group and chapter of Bike Cleveland. Advocates for a safe and complete active transportation network. Emily Lindberg represented Bike Lakewood on the Active Transportation plan stakeholder team.
- **[Bike Cleveland](https://www.bikecleveland.org/)** — The regional bicycle advocacy organization for Greater Cleveland. Bike Lakewood operates as a local chapter.
- **[LakewoodAlive](https://www.lakewoodalive.org/)** — Community development organization that participated as a stakeholder in the Active Transportation planning process.
