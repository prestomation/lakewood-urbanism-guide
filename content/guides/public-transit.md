# Public Transit in Lakewood

Lakewood is served by the [Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA)](https://www.riderta.com/), which operates bus routes and rapid rail service through the city. While transit access exists, coverage is uneven, and "last mile" connectivity remains a challenge.

## Current Service

### Bus Routes

Lakewood is served by [six RTA bus routes](https://www.riderta.com/routes):

| Route | Corridor | Key Destinations |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | Madison Avenue | Lakewood Park to Parma Transit Center |
| 26 | Detroit Avenue area | Local connections |
| 43 | Local service | Neighborhood connections |
| 55 | Clifton Boulevard | Downtown Cleveland to North Olmsted (55B to Bay Village, 55C to Crocker Park) |
| 78 | Local service | Cross-city connections |
| 83 | Local service | Additional connections |

### Rapid Rail

Two [RTA Red Line](https://www.riderta.com/routes) rapid transit stations serve Lakewood residents, both on the city's eastern border:
- **W. 117th Station** — On the boundary with Cleveland
- **Triskett Station** — Slightly east, providing access to the Red Line

These stations connect Lakewood to downtown Cleveland, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, and other Red Line destinations.

## Last Mile Challenge

The most significant transit issue in Lakewood is the ["last mile" gap](https://www.ideastream.org/community/2024-04-24/lakewood-studying-options-to-close-the-last-mile-gap-in-public-transit) — the distance between a bus or rail stop and a rider's actual destination.

In 2024, the city [hired Iteris Inc.](https://www.ideastream.org/community/2024-04-24/lakewood-studying-options-to-close-the-last-mile-gap-in-public-transit) to study options for closing this gap, using nearly $150,000 in county-awarded American Rescue Act funds. As Council President Sarah Kepple noted: "Connecting the dots between the existing broader RTA infrastructure in Lakewood is what we've heard from residents is needed."

The study came roughly 15 years after the **Lakewood Community Circulator** was discontinued. The circulator had provided local transit connections within the city. Current options are limited to a transportation van serving senior citizens and people with disabilities.

## History

### Pre-1893: Horse and Foot

Before streetcar access, Lakewood was a rural area of farms and estates. Transportation was limited to horse-drawn vehicles and walking along Detroit Road.

### 1893–1916: Streetcar Era

The [streetcar system](https://lakewoodhistory.org/preservation/a-brief-history-of-lakewood/) defined Lakewood's development:
- **1893:** Detroit Avenue line opened
- **1903:** Clifton Boulevard line opened
- **1916:** Madison Avenue line opened

Streetcar lines drove population growth from roughly 3,000 in 1900 to over 41,000 by 1920.

### Mid-20th Century: Streetcar Removal

Like most American cities, Cleveland's streetcar system was dismantled in favor of buses and automobiles. The transit corridors remained as bus routes, but service levels declined over time.

### 2013: Enhanced Transit Environments

RTA planned [enhanced transit waiting environments](https://www.lakewoodoh.gov/community-vision/mobility/) for Routes 55 (Clifton) and 25 (Madison) — improvements to bus stops and shelters along these key corridors.

### 2024: Last Mile Study

The city commissioned the [Iteris study](https://www.ideastream.org/community/2024-04-24/lakewood-studying-options-to-close-the-last-mile-gap-in-public-transit) to evaluate local transit options, the first formal analysis of this kind since the circulator was discontinued.

## Advocacy Organizations

- **[RTA Riders Alliance](https://www.riderta.com/)** — Advocacy for improved regional transit service
- **[Bike Lakewood](https://www.bikecleveland.org/bikelakewood/)** — Advocates for multimodal connections including transit access
- **[LakewoodAlive](https://www.lakewoodalive.org/)** — Community development organization engaged in mobility discussions
